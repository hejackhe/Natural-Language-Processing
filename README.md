# Natural Language Processing
This is a project involving the use of natural language processing, working on the SIGNAL NEWS1 corpus.
The SIGNAL NEWS1 corpus contains thousands of individual news stories.
I first preprocess the data before conducting sentiment analysis on the cleaned data.
Then I construct a trigram language model and generate some fun sentence predictions.
Finally, I experiment with laplace smoothing before computing the perplexity of my language model.
