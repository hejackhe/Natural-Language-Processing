# Natural Language Processing

This is a project involving the use of natural language processing, working on the SIGNAL NEWS1 corpus.

The SIGNAL NEWS1 corpus contains thousands of individual news stories.

1. I first preprocess the data before conducting sentiment analysis on the cleaned data.

2. Then I construct a trigram language model and generate some fun sentence predictions.

3. Finally, I experiment with laplace smoothing before computing the perplexity of my language model.
