# Natural Language Processing
This is a project involving the use of natural language processing, working on the SIGNAL NEWS1 corpus.\n
The SIGNAL NEWS1 corpus contains thousands of individual news stories.\n
I first preprocess the data before conducting sentiment analysis on the cleaned data.\n
Then I construct a trigram language model and generate some fun sentence predictions.\n
Finally, I experiment with laplace smoothing before computing the perplexity of my language model.\n
